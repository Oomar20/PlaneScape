React Flight Booking App
This project is a Flight Booking Application built using React and Vite. It allows users to search for flights, view flight details, and book flights. The application also provides additional services such as car rentals, hotels, and travel packages.

Features:
Flight Search and Booking: Users can search for available flights based on departure and arrival airports, select flight types (one-way or round-trip), and book flights.
Dynamic Flight Filtering: Flights can be sorted by price, and users can choose from different filtering options such as stops and airlines.
Car Rentals, Hotels, and Travel Packages: Additional services for users to explore.
Error Handling: A custom 404 page is displayed when users navigate to a non-existent route.
Technologies:
React: Frontend framework used for building the user interface.
Vite: Fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
React Router: For handling page navigation and routing.
MongoDB: Used for storing flight data.
Express.js: Backend framework used for handling API requests.
Mongoose: For object data modeling (ODM) and MongoDB schema definitions.
React Toastify: For providing notifications when actions like booking a flight are performed.
Installation and Running the Project
Prerequisites:
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed (v14 or above is recommended).
NPM or Yarn: Install Node Package Manager (npm comes with Node.js) or Yarn to manage dependencies.
Steps to Run:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-booking-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd flight-booking-app
Install dependencies: Using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Or using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn
Run the development server: Using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Or using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn dev
This command will start the Vite development server. You can access the project at http://localhost:3000.

Build the project (for production): Using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Or using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn build
This will bundle the application into static files for production.

Preview the production build: After building the project, you can run:

bash
Copy code
npm run preview
Or using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn preview
This command will serve the production build locally.

Backend Setup:
If your project includes a backend (Express.js with MongoDB), follow these additional steps:

Set up the backend: Ensure that your backend API server is running. It should be connected to MongoDB (using Mongoose).

Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the root of your backend folder and configure your MongoDB connection string and any other API keys or settings.

Start the backend server: After setting up the backend, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run server
Or using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn server
This will start the Express.js backend on a specified port (e.g., http://localhost:5000).

Folder Structure:
src: Contains all the frontend code (React components, pages, assets).
backend: Contains backend files (Express routes, Mongoose models, etc.).
public: Public static assets like images and fonts.

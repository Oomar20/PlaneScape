This project is a **Flight Booking Application** built using **React** and **Vite**. It allows users to search for flights, view flight details, and book flights. The application also provides additional services such as car rentals, hotels, and travel packages.

## Features:
- **Flight Search and Booking**: Users can search for available flights based on departure and arrival airports, select flight types (one-way or round-trip), and book flights.
- **Dynamic Flight Filtering**: Flights can be sorted by price, and users can choose from different filtering options such as stops and airlines.
- **Error Handling**: A custom 404 page is displayed when users navigate to a non-existent route.

## Technologies:
- **React**: Frontend framework used for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Router**: For handling page navigation and routing.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing flight data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework used for handling API requests.
- **Mongoose**: For object data modeling (ODM) and MongoDB schema definitions.
- **React Toastify**: For providing notifications when actions like booking a flight are performed.
